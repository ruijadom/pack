# TSDX React w/ Storybook User Guide

Congrats! You just saved yourself hours of work by bootstrapping this project with TSDX. Let’s get you oriented with what’s here and how to use it.

> This TSDX setup is meant for developing React component libraries (not apps!) that can be published to NPM. If you’re looking to build a React-based app, you should use `create-react-app`, `razzle`, `nextjs`, `gatsby`, or `react-static`.
